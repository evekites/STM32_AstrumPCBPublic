# Project description

This project demonstrates how you can use printf() to send data to the Virtual Com Port (VCP) on de USB-C connector. When you run this project, a Virtual Com Port (COMxx) will be created. Using a Serial Port program (PuTTY, Arduino's Serial Monitor, Tera Term etc..) you can see the output of the printf() commands.
