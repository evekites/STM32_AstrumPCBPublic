# Project description

This project uses a Grove Buzzer module connected to the GPIO3 Grove connector.

It uses a PWM timer to produce a sound that varies in frequency. The code is placed just before the while(1) loop, otherwise it is very annoying!

### !!This code does not (yet) work with the onboard buzzer!!
