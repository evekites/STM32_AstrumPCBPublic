# STM32_AstrumPCBPublic

This repo is for Software Development students of the Astrum College, Velp, The Netherlands.

All code in this repo is written for the "C-University development board" used for the Embedded Software lessons for 2nd year MBO Software Development students at the Astrum College in Velp The Netherlands. This STM32 development board was developed for the Astrum College by Gemini Embedded Technology / C-University.

The projects in here are numbered 000-099 and 1000-1999 each with its own aproach, see the following readme's:

- README 000-099.md
- README 1000-1999.md

Documentation for the "C-University development board v1" can be found in the folder "1000 - docs"
