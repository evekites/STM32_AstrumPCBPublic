# Project setup and configuration

Projects are created in the [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) development tool.

1.  Start a new STM32 project from an existing .ioc file. Select the file **\_prj_template.ioc** located in this folder.
2.  Give the project a name, such as **Example project**.
3.  Click _Finish_ and wait for the configuration to finish.

    _Note. If you are using a newer version of STM32CubeIDE, you might be asked to migrate to this newer version. Click **Migrate** when asked._

4.  Close the .ioc file.
5.  Several files have now been created, but we need to add our board support files and examples. In explorer, copy/replace **all** the board support files from the folder **./1000 - bsp** to the project at the same indicated location.
    ```
    ├─ Core
    │  ├─ Inc
    │  │  └─ *.h
    │  └─ Src
    │     └─ *.c
    ├─ Middlewares
    │  └─ ST
    │     └─ LSM6DSO32x-PID
    │        └─ *.*
    └─ USB_Device
       └─ App
          └─ *.*
    ```
6.  Copy the source files from **one** of the examples to the project:

    ```
    └─ Core
       ├─ Inc
       │  └─ example_main.h
       └─ Src
          └─ example_main.c
    ```

    _Note. Refresh the project in STM32CubeIDE (F5) if the files are not immediately visible._

7.  Open the file **./Core/main.c**.

    a. Add the following include:

    ```C
    /* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
    #include "example_main.h"
    /* USER CODE END Includes */
    ```

    b. And add a call to the example main function:

    ```C
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
    example_main();
    /* USER CODE END 2 */
    ```

8.  If you would like to also use the IMU in your project, an additional step is required.
    In STM32CubeIDE add the following folder to the include path of the compiler. There is more than one way to do this, but a convenient way is to right-click the folder in STM32CubeIDE and select **Add/remove include path...** .
    ```
    ├─ Middlewares
    │  └─ ST
    │     └─ LSM6DSO32x-PID
    ```
9.  Build and run the application.
